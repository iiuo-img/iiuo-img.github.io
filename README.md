# It Is Unique Official – Image Placeholder / Legacy Site

---

## 🌐 Project Overview  
This repository hosts the static site for the image placeholder service formerly provided by *It Is Unique Official*. While the interactive placeholder service is discontinued (as of Oct 25 2025), this repo remains as an archival landing page.

---

## 📌 What you’ll find here  
- The static HTML/CSS/JS for the landing page announcing the shutdown of the placeholder service.  
- Historic context, and pointers to alternative services.  
- No live image endpoint functionality is provided by this site any longer.

---

## ❗ Service Status  
As of **October 25, 2025**, the placeholder image service has been officially **shut down**.  
This decision was made due to increasing hosting and maintenance costs, coupled with limited ongoing usage and support.  

Existing links pointing to the service’s endpoints will no longer resolve.  
We encourage developers/designers still using the endpoints to migrate to other solutions (see Alternatives section below).

---

## 🔧 Alternatives & Migration Suggestions  
If you used our image-placeholder service and now need replacements, consider:  
- [Placeholder.com](https://placeholder.com)  
- [Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos)  
- Hosting a self-managed placeholder service or script  

When updating your projects:  
- Search for any URLs that reference `img.itisuniqueofficial.com` and replace them.  
- Test designs to ensure placeholder images load correctly.  
- Update documentation, design assets, and templates accordingly.
